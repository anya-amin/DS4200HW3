I customized my website using a CSS file (style.css) that applies consistent fonts, colors, and layout styling across all pages.
In terms of all the customizations I have done to the website, I first used a custom font called "Trebuchet MS" as the main font. 
This was applied to all of fonts throughout the entire website. Moreover, I used a pastel palette for the website. The header on 
both pages are a light teal, while the footer is a lavender color. The page background is a white color. And the lists have a 
light blue background color. Putting all of these colors together, it created an aesthetically colored website. In terms of the 
image styling, I wanted to keep all of the images consistent. They all have rounded corners and drop shadows on each. In the header, 
when the user selects the tab, it will be underlined to indicate that you are about to select it. In terms of padding, layout and 
adjustments, all the decisions made for this, were all to make the readability of the website easier. The large chunk of texts were 
all centered, with padding and margins that would make the text fit right on the page. The lists are all left aligned with bullets 
are margins that would allow them to fit inside of the box. Together, these design choices make the website feel cohesive, friendly, 
and easy to read.
