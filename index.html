        Hello! My name is Anya Amin, and I am so excited to share a little bit about myself and the things that inspire me. To begin, I am a third year at Northeastern University
        studying Computer Science and Business Administration with a concentration in Fintech. I have been passionate about technology for years, and have known that I wanted to go 
        into this field for a while. With that, I have always been curious about the world around me. Beyond the classroom, I am extremely interested 
        in climate change. I have done research about understanding how climate change affects our planet and moreover finding creative ways to make a positive impact. It has been a 
        passion of try and spread awareness about climate change and ways that humans themselves can help on their 
        part ensure that they are contributing to better the planet. I have done many research papers in the past about this and am constantly reading about current news on this topics. 
        I believe that every small action we take matters. Beyond my environmental interests, I am passionate about music, baking, and travel. I have been playing the violin for 
        several years, and is often a time I can relax when I go home. I also love baking and in general trying new recipes. Traveling also plays a huge role in my life; I love 
        exploring new cultures, meeting people from different backgrounds, and discovering how diverse our world is. This website is a small reflection of who I am and 
        the things that shape my life.
