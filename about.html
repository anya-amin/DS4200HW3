      <p>
        To dive deeper into my interests, I believe that it is super important to have a variety that can reflect a mix of creativity, 
        curiosity, and care for the world. It has always been hard for me to be a creative person, but playing the violin allows me to do that, 
        and I can express my creativity through sound in this scenario. Even when it comes to baking as well, I can express my creativity through 
        trying new recipes or even just come up with new combinations of ingredients. Then my curiosity and care can come from my interest in traveling 
        the world and being passionate about climate change. Traveling allows me to gain different perspectives and be curious about the world. It has 
        also helped me observe how climate differs across places I have visited, deepening my interest in environmental issues. As climate change, is one of the
        biggest challenges our generation is facing, I have been passionate about researching and finding ways to make a difference. 
      </p>

        <p>        
        All of this is important for balance. It keeps me grounded, motivated and happy that I have these hobbies and interests. At the same time, 
        I am working to have a career in tech that allows me to make a positive impact on the world. This was just a little insight and piece into 
        what I love beyond my career goals!
